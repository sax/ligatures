  <h3>Amy Zing</h3>
  <p>
  Amy has been playing the saw since she was a tiny tike. Passed down
  from generation to generation from time immemorial, as a toddler
  she would use it to cut up family furniture for fire wood. 
  Later in life she added sequines and took it on the road, performing
  balancing acts to gratify and astound. Recently she discovered that
  it makes noises when you rub horsehair on it, and new musical vistas
  were unlocked. Amy is amazing.

  <h3>Natashia Mitchell</h3>
  <p>
  Little Tashie was once a member of a five-ring circus, forced to
  perform by unyielding parents determined that she succeed at fame
  and recognition when their spotlight dwindled. Wrangling tigers with
  only her stern, powerful voice to aid her, Natashia learned to
  stand strong. Eventually running away, she tried to find a normal,
  stable life doing software licensing and accounting. The wind called
  to her on lonely nights, however, whispering soft accordion notes
  until she could no longer resist. Now she beats up drums and other
  instruments.

  <h3>Eric Saxby</h3>
  <p>
  Mr. Saxby is an itinerant ukulele player. Locked in an alternate
  universe populated only by glam rock icons and computer nerds
  for a significant portion
  of his young life, when he at long last escaped to normal reality
  his psychological scars left him fey and unable to socialize.
  Nursed back to health by the beautiful Natashia, he was gradually
  withdrawn from his silver lam√© jumpsuit and introduced to other
  social and cultural outlets: the Mods. Now struggling to define
  his personal relationship between his Mod and Rock backgrounds,
  Saxby is a confused, confused man.
